Scientific Question: There are currently two primary vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 from infecting humans, how do the Moderna and Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines differ in mRNA sequence?
Hypothesis: If we know that Moderna is supposed to be a more effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 than Pfizer based off of vaccine effectiveness, then by studying the gene sequence of both Moderna and Pfizer we can identify what makes Moderna more effective than Pfizer.
